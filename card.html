            Front-End Development
            Front-end development focuses on the parts of a website that users interact with directly. This includes:
            
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard language for creating web pages. It structures the content on the web.
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used to style and layout web pages. It controls the visual presentation of HTML elements.
            JavaScript: A programming language that adds interactivity to web pages. It can be used for tasks like form validation, dynamic content updates, and animations.</p>

            System Software: This type of software manages and controls the hardware components of a computer, providing a platform for other software to run. Examples include operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as device drivers and utility programs.

        <p>UI Design
            UI design focuses on the visual and interactive elements of a product. It involves designing the look and feel of the interface, including buttons, icons, spacing, typography, and color schemes. The goal is to create an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive interface that enhances user interaction.<br>
            
            UX Design
            UX design, on the other hand, is about the overall experience a user has with a product. It involves understanding user needs, conducting research, and designing interfaces that are easy to use and provide a seamless experience. UX design covers aspects like usability, accessibility, and the overall satisfaction a user derives from interacting with the product.
